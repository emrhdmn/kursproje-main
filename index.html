            so-called science and real archaeological mysteries, be the world's
            first astronomical observatory?

          <h1>The Zero Point of History; Göbeklitepe</h1>
          <p>
            Located in the Germuş mountains of Southeastern Anatolia, this
            property offers monumental round-oval and rectangular megalithic
            structures built by hunter-gatherers in the Decrepit Neolithic
            Period between 9,600 and 8,200 BC. These monuments were probably
            used in connection with rituals related to funeral ceremonies. The
            distinctive T-shaped columns are carved with wild animal paintings
            that give an insight into the lifestyles and beliefs of the people
            who lived in Upper Mesopotamia about 11,500 years ago.
